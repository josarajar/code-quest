The code contains two functions: `count_elements_brute_force` and `count_elements`. Both functions aim to count the number of elements in a sorted matrix that are smaller than `matrix[i1][j1]` and larger than `matrix[i2][j2]`.

**`count_elements_brute_force(matrix, i1, j1, i2, j2)`**
This function uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem. It iterates through the entire matrix and checks each element to see if it falls within the given range. The time complexity of this approach is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.

**`count_elements(matrix, i1, j1, i2, j2)`**
This function uses a more efficient approach to solve the problem. It takes advantage of the fact that the matrix is sorted to reduce the number of computations. The key steps are:

1. **Count rows smaller than i1**: For each row before `i1`, it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to `matrix[i1][j1]` and adds the number of elements in that row up to that point to the result.
2. **Count columns smaller than j1**: For each column before `j1` and starting from `i1+1`, it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to `matrix[i1][j1]` and adds the number of elements in that column up to that point to the result.
3. **Count rows greater than i2**: For each row after `i2`, it finds the first element that is less than or equal to `matrix[i2][j2]` and adds the number of elements in that row from that point onwards to the result.
4. **Count columns greater than j2**: For each column after `j2` and starting from `i2`, it finds the first element that is less than or equal to `matrix[i2][j2]` and adds the number of elements in that column from that point onwards to the result.

The time complexity of this approach is O(result), where "result" is the number of elements in the given range. This is more efficient than the brute-force approach, especially when the range is small compared to the size of the matrix.

Both functions also print the number of operations performed during the computation.

The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to call these functions with a sample matrix and the expected output.
